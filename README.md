# Learning how to consuming an API using EJS
- Ejs (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating language often used with Node.js for dynamic content generation in web applications.

The idea of the project was to practice the habilities and knowledges acquired during the second semester of the course, to use later in [Primavessi](https://github.com/juliaenriquetto/Projeto-Primavessi).
